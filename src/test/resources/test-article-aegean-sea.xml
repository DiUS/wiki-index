The '''Aegean Sea'''[[#References|&lt;sup&gt;[p]&lt;/sup&gt;]] ({{lang-el|Αιγαίο Πέλαγος}}, ''Egeo Pelagos'' {{IPA-el|eˈʝeo ˈpelaɣos||Ell-Aigaio Pelagos.ogg}};  {{lang-tr|Ege Denizi}} or historically {{lang-tr|Adalar Denizi}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzkk.tsk.tr/turkce/BunlariBiliyormuydunuz/EgeDenizininOrjinalAdi.php Ege Denizinin Orijinal Adı Nedir?, Turkish Naval Force web site (in Turkish)] &lt;/ref&gt;) is an elongated embayment of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] located between the southern [[Balkans|Balkan]] and [[Anatolia]]n [[peninsula]]s, i.e., between the mainlands of [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]]. In the north, it is connected to the [[Marmara Sea]] and [[Black Sea]] by the [[Dardanelles]] and [[Bosporus]]. The [[Aegean Islands]] are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including [[Crete]] and [[Rhodes]]. The [[Aegean Region, Turkey|Aegean Region]] consists of nine provinces in southwestern Turkey, in part bordering on the Aegean sea.

The sea was traditionally known as ''[[Archipelago]]'' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ''Αρχιπέλαγος'', meaning &quot;chief sea&quot;), but in English this word's meaning has changed to refer to the Aegean Islands and, generally, to any island group.

==Geography==
The Aegean Sea covers about {{convert|214000|km2}} in area, and measures about {{convert|610|km}} longitudinally and {{convert|300|km}} latitudinally. The sea's maximum depth is {{convert|3543|m}}, east of Crete. The [[Aegean Islands]] are found within its waters, with the following islands delimiting the sea on the south (generally from west to east): [[Kythera]], [[Antikythera]], Crete, [[Kasos]], [[Karpathos]] and Rhodes.

The Aegean Islands, which almost all belong to Greece, can be divided into seven groups: 

#[[List of Aegean Islands#The North Aegean Islands|Northeastern Aegean Islands]]
#[[Euboea]]
#Northern [[Sporades]]
#[[Cyclades]]
#[[Saronic Islands]] (or ''[[Argo-Saronic Islands]]'')
#[[Dodecanese]] (or ''Southern Sporades''), with the exclusion of [[Kastelorizo]]
#[[Crete]]

The word ''[[archipelago]]'' was originally applied specifically to the Aegean Sea and its islands. Many of the Aegean Islands, or chains of islands, are actually extensions of the mountains on the mainland. One chain extends across the sea to [[Chios]], another extends across [[Euboea]] to [[Samos Island|Samos]], and a third extends across the [[Peloponnese]] and Crete to Rhodes, dividing the Aegean from the Mediterranean.

The bays and gulfs of the Aegean beginning and the South and moving clockwise include on Crete, the [[Mirabelli Gulf|Mirabelli]], [[Almyros Bay|Almyros]], [[Souda Bay|Souda]] and [[Gulf of Chania|Chania]] bays or gulfs, on the mainland the [[Myrtoan Sea]] to the west, the [[Saronic Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Petalies Gulf]] which connects with the [[Gulf of Euboea|South Euboic Sea]], the [[Pagasetic Gulf]] which connects with the [[Gulf of Euboea|North Euboic Sea]], the [[Thermian Gulf]] northwestward, the [[Chalkidiki]] Peninsula including the [[Cassandra Gulf|Cassandra]] and the [[Singitic Gulf]]s, northward the [[Strymonian Gulf]] and the [[Gulf of Kavala]] and the rest are in [[Turkey]]; [[Saros Gulf]], [[Edremit (District), Balıkesir|Edremit]] Gulf, Dikili Gulf, Çandarlı Gulf, [[İzmir]] Gulf, [[Kuşadası]] Gulf, [[Gulf of Gökova]], [[Güllük]] Gulf.

===Extent===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Aegean Sea as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho-ohi.net/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S23_1953.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrography===
[[File:Cliffs of Santorini.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The cliffs in Santorini Island, [[Greece]]]]
Aegean surface water circulates in a counter-clockwise gyre, with [[hypersaline]] Mediterranean water moving northward along the west coast of [[Turkey]], before being displaced by less dense [[Black Sea]] outflow. The dense [[Mediterranean]] water sinks below the Black Sea inflow to a depth of {{convert|23|-|30|m}}, then flows through the [[Dardanelles Strait]] and into the [[Sea of Marmara]] at velocities of 5–15&amp;nbsp;cm/s. The Black Sea outflow moves westward along the northern Aegean Sea, then flows southwards along the east coast of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Aksu, A. E., D. Yasar, et al. (1995). &quot;LATE GLACIAL-HOLOCENE PALEOCLIMATIC AND PALEOCEANOGRAPHIC EVOLUTION OF THE AEGEAN SEA – MICROPALEONTOLOGICAL AND STABLE ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE.&quot; Marine Micropaleontology 25(1): 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical oceanography of the Aegean Sea is controlled mainly by the regional climate, the fresh water discharge from major rivers draining southeastern Europe, and the seasonal variations in the Black Sea surface water outflow through the [[Dardanelles Strait]].

Analysis&lt;ref&gt;Yagar, D., 1994. Late glacial-Holocene evolution of the Aegean Sea. Ph.D. Thesis, Inst. Mar. Sci. Technol., Dokuz Eyltil Univ., 329 pp. (Unpubl.)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Aegean during 1991 and 1992 revealed 3 distinct water masses:

*'''Aegean Sea Surface Water''' – {{convert|40|-|50|m}} thick veneer, with summer temperatures of 21–26&amp;nbsp;°C and winter temperatures ranging from {{convert|10|°C}} in the north to {{convert|16|°C}} in the south.
*'''Aegean Sea Intermediate Water''' – Aegean Sea Intermediate Water extends from 40–50&amp;nbsp;m to {{convert|200|-|300|m}} with temperatures ranging from 11–18&amp;nbsp;°C.
*'''Aegean Sea Bottom Water''' – occurring at depths below 500–1000&amp;nbsp;m with a very uniform temperature (13–14&amp;nbsp;°C) and salinity (39.1–39.2%).

==Etymology==
In ancient times, there were various explanations for the name ''Aegean''. It was said to have been named after the Greek town of [[Aegae (Achaea)|Aegae]], or after [[Aegea]], a queen of the [[Amazons]] who died in the sea, or Aigaion, the &quot;sea goat&quot;, another name of [[Briareus]], one of the archaic [[Hecatonchires]], or, especially among the Athenians, [[Aegeus]], the father of [[Theseus]], who drowned himself in the sea when he thought his son had died.

A possible etymology is a derivation from the Greek word ''{{Polytonic|αἶγες}}'' &amp;ndash; ''aiges'' = &quot;''waves''&quot; ([[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] [[Alexandria|of Alexandria]]; metaphorical use of {{Polytonic|αἴξ}} (''aix'') &quot;goat&quot;), hence &quot;wavy sea&quot;, cf. also {{Polytonic|αἰγιαλός}} (aigialos = aiges ''(waves)'' + hals ''(sea)''),&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dai)gialo%2Fs αἰγιαλός] at [[LSI]]&lt;/ref&gt; hence meaning &quot;sea-shore&quot;.

==History==
[[File:Aegean Sea by Piri Reis.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Historic map of Aegean Sea by [[Piri Reis]]]]
The current coastline dates back to about 4000 BC.  Before that time, at the peak of the [[last ice age]] (c. 16,000 BC) sea levels everywhere [[sea level rise|were 130 metres lower]], and there were large well-watered coastal plains instead of much of the northern Aegean. When they were first occupied, the present-day islands including [[Milos]] with its important [[obsidian]] production were probably still connected to the mainland.  The present coastal arrangement appeared c. 7000 BC, with post-ice age sea levels continuing to rise for another 3,000 years after that.&lt;ref&gt;Tjeerd H. van Andel and Judith C. Shackleton, [http://www.jstor.org/pss/529681?cookieSet=1 Late Paleolithic and Mesolithic Coastlines of Greece and the Aegean], ''Journal of Field Archaeology'', Vol. 9, No. 4 (Winter, 1982), pp. 445–454&lt;/ref&gt;

The subsequent [[Bronze Age]] civilizations of [[Greece]] and the Aegean Sea have given rise to the general term ''[[Aegean civilization]]''. In ancient times, the sea was the birthplace of two ancient civilizations&amp;nbsp;– the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]] of Crete and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenean]] Civilization of the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracey Cullen, ''Aegean Prehistory: A Review'' (American Journal of Archaeology. Supplement, 1); Oliver Dickinson, ''The Aegean Bronze Age'' (Cambridge World Archaeology).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aegeansea.jpg|thumb|left|]]
Later arose the city-states of [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] among many others that constituted the [[Athenian Empire]] and [[Hellenic Civilization]]. Plato described the Greeks living round the Aegean &quot;like frogs around a pond&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The familiar phrase giving rise to the title ''Prehistorians Round the Pond: Reflections on Aegean Prehistory as a Discipline'', by John F. Cherry, Despina Margomenou, and Lauren E. Talalay.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aegean Sea was later invaded by the [[Persian Empire|Persians]] and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], and inhabited by the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Bulgarians]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoeses]], the [[Seljuq Turks]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Aegean was the site of the original [[democracy|democracies]], and its seaways were the means of contact among several diverse civilizations of the Eastern Mediterranean.

==Economics and politics==

Many of the islands in the Aegean have safe harbours and bays. In ancient times, navigation through the sea was easier than travelling across the rough terrain of the Greek mainland (and to some extent the coastal areas of Anatolia). Many of the islands are [[Volcano|volcanic]], and [[marble]] and [[iron]] are mined on other islands. The larger islands have some fertile valleys and plains. Of the main islands in the Aegean Sea, two belong to [[Turkey]] – [[Bozcaada]] (Tenedos) and [[Gökçeada]] (Imbros); the rest belong to [[Greece]]. Between the two countries, there are [[Aegean dispute|political disputes]] over several aspects of political control over the Aegean space, including the size of territorial waters, air control and the [[delimitation]] of economic rights to the [[continental shelf]].
