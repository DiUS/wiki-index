'''A''' ({{IPAc-en|En-us-A.ogg|eɪ}}; [[English_alphabet#Letter_names|named]] ''a'', plural ''aes'')&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; is the first [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] and a [[vowel]] in the [[basic modern Latin alphabet]]. It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter [[Alpha]], from which it derives.

==Origins==
&quot;A&quot; may have started as a [[pictogram]] of an [[ox]] head in [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]. It has stood at the head of every alphabet in which it has been found, the earliest of which being the Phoenician.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;

In 1600 B.C., the [[Phoenician alphabet]]'s letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] [[aleph]].

When the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the [[glottal stop]] that the letter had denoted in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]] and other [[Semitic languages]], so they used the sign to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}, and kept its name with a minor change ([[alpha (letter)|alpha]]). In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the [[Greek Dark Ages]], dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the [[Greek alphabet]] of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The [[Etruscans]] brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan alphabet]] to write the [[Latin language]], and the resulting letter was preserved in the modern [[Latin alphabet]] used to write many languages, including [[English language|English]].

[[File:LowercaseA.svg|right|thumb|200|Typographic variants include a double-story '''a''' and single-story '''ɑ'''.]]
The letter has two [[lower case|minuscule]] (lower-case) forms. The form used in most current [[handwriting]] consists of a circle and vertical stroke ({{Unicode|&quot;ɑ&quot;}}), called [[Latin alpha]] or &quot;script a&quot;. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter [[tau]] in the hands of dark-age Irish and English writers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; Most printed material uses a form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it ({{Unicode|&quot;a&quot;}}). Both derive from the [[majuscule]] (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the Uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the [[serif]] that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

==Usage==
{{main|a (disambiguation)}}
The letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds. In English, &quot;a&quot; by itself frequently denotes the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/æ/}}) as in ''pad''; the [[open back unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/ɑː/}}) as in ''father'', its original, Latin and Greek, sound; a closer, further fronted sound as in &quot;hare&quot;, which developed as the sound progressed from &quot;father&quot; to &quot;ace&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong {{IPA|/eɪ/}} as in ''ace'' and ''major'', due to effects of the [[great vowel shift]]; the more rounded form in &quot;water&quot; or its closely-related cousin, found in &quot;was&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;

In most other languages that use the Latin alphabet, &quot;a&quot; denotes an [[open front unrounded vowel]] ({{IPA|/a/}}). In the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]], variants of &quot;a&quot; denote various [[vowel]]s. In [[X-SAMPA]], capital &quot;A&quot; denotes the [[open back unrounded vowel]] and lowercase &quot;a&quot; denotes the [[open front unrounded vowel]].

&quot;A&quot; is the third most commonly used letter in English, and the second most common in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]]. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English tend to be ‹a›s, while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trinity College&quot; /&gt;

&quot;A&quot; is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; A grade for clean restaurants; [[A-List]] celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a [[motivation|motivating]] effect as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.sciencealert.com.au/news/20100903-20689.html |title=Letters affect exam results |date=9 March 2010 |publisher=British Psychological Society |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[turned a|turned &quot;a&quot;]], {{IPA|‹ɐ›}} is used by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] for the [[near-open central vowel]], while a turned capital &quot;A&quot; (&quot;∀&quot;) is used in [[predicate logic]] to specify [[universal quantification]].

==Computing codes==
[[File:A-small glyphs.svg|thumb|140px|Different [[glyphs]] of Unicode U+0061.]]

In [[Unicode]], the [[majuscule|capital]] &quot;A&quot; is codepoint U+0041 and the [[lower case]] &quot;a&quot; is U+0061.&lt;ref name=&quot;unicode&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The closed form ({{Unicode|&quot;ɑ&quot;}}), which is related with the lowercase [[alpha]], has codepoint U+0251 (from the Code Chart &quot;IPA Extensions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0250.pdf Unicode.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ASCII]] code for capital &quot;A&quot; is 65 and for lower case &quot;a&quot; is 97; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 01000001 and 01100001, respectively.

The [[EBCDIC]] code for capital &quot;A&quot; is 193 and for lowercase &quot;a&quot; is 129; or in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 11000001 and 10000001, respectively.

The [[numeric character reference]]s in [[HTML]] and [[XML]] are &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#65;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#97;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; for upper and lower case, respectively.
