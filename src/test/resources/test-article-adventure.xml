[[File:Walking Across Log.JPG|thumb|Activities such as [[hiking]] and [[exploring]] can be seen as adventurous.]]

An '''adventure''' is defined as an exciting or unusual experience; it may also be a bold, usually [[risk|risky]] undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure Dictionary.com Unabridged]. Retrieved 4 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to refer to activities with some potential for physical danger, such as [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]] and or participating in [[extreme sports]]. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, a love affair, or other major life undertakings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/travel/23borneo.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://intransit.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/a-new-entrant-in-adventure-travel-outfitters/ New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/services/newspaper/mediacenter/releases/la-mediacenter-2009-0224,0,6901938.story Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/travel/destinations/outdoorsadventure/ Los Angeles Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Adventurous experiences create psychological and physiological [[arousal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6YjcgAn8TfsC&amp;pg=PA187 |title=On the psychobiology of personality |chapter=Sensation Seeking and Participation in Physical Risk Sports |author=M Gomà-i-Freixanet |year=2004 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-044209-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]), and which can be detrimental as stated by the [[Yerkes-Dodson law]].  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer [[André Malraux]], in his ''La Condition Humaine'' (1933), &quot;If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?&quot;. Similarly, [[Helen Keller]] stated that &quot;Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.&quot;

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of [[recreation]] or [[excitement]]: examples are  [[adventure racing]] and [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers. [[Adventure education]] intentionally uses challenging experiences for [[learning]].

==Adventure in mythology==
Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as [[Homer|Homer's]] ''[[The Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/reviews/fagles-odyssey.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, P. (1974). ''The adventurer: The fate of adventure in the Western world'', New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] discussed his notion of the [[monomyth]] in his book, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the &quot;call to adventure&quot;, followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph. The [[adventure novel]] exhibits these &quot;protagonist on adventurous journey&quot; characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as ''[[Star Wars]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/26/movies/moviesspecial/26STAR.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AA42CA1494CC6B6799D836896 New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adventurers==
An adventurer is a person who bases his lifestyle or their fortunes on adventurous acts. An adventurer or adventuress is a term that usually takes one of three meanings:

*One whose travels are unusual and often exotic, though not so unique as to qualify as [[exploration]].
*One who lives by their wits.
*One who takes part in a risky or speculative course of action for profit or position.

In fiction, the adventurer figure or [[Picaro]] may be regarded as a descendant of the [[knight-errant]] of [[Medieval]] [[romance (genre)|romance]]. Like the knight, the adventurer roams through episodic encounters, usually involving wealth, romance, or fighting. Unlike the knight, the adventurer was a realistic figure, often lower class or otherwise impoverished, who is forced to make his way to fortune, often by deceit. Also, an adventurer is a roguish hero of low social class who lives by his or her wits in a corrupt society.  The [[picaresque]] novel originated in [[Spain]] in the middle of the fifteenth century. Novels such as [[Lazarillo de Tormes]] were influential across Europe. Throughout the eighteenth century, a great number of  novels featured bold, amoral, adventuring protagonists, who made their way into wealth and happiness, sometimes with and sometimes without the moral conversion that generally accompanies the Spanish model.

Under [[Victorian morality]] the term, used without qualifiers, came to imply a person of low [[moral character]], often someone trying to marry for money.

In comic books such as ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' and ''[[Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe]]'', the term &quot;adventurer&quot; is used as a synonym for &quot;[[super-hero]]&quot; when listing a character's occupation.

In [[role-playing games]], the [[player characters]] are often professional adventurers, who earn wealth and fame by adventure, such as undertaking hazardous missions, exploring ruins, and slaying monsters. This stereotype is strong enough that ''the adventurers'' can often be used as a synonym for ''the player characters''. [[Non-player character]] groups of adventurers can also exist, and can be an interesting encounter for the players.
