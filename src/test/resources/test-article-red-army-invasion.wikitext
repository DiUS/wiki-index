      The '''Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan''', also known as the '''Sovietization of Azerbaijan''', was a military campaign carried out by the [[11th Army (Soviet Union)|11th Army]] of [[Soviet Russia]] on [[April 27]] - [[May 1]], [[1920]] to overthrow the government of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] and to install a Bolshevik regime in the country.

===Background===
By early 1920, [[Soviet Russia]] desperately needed oil supplies from [[Baku]]. On [[March 17]], [[1920]], [[Lenin]] sent the following telegraph to the Revolutionary Military Council of the Caucasus Front:

{{quotation|We absolutely must take Baku. Direct all your efforts to this end, but it is necessary to remain strictly diplomatic in your statements and to ensure to a maximum extent a solid preparation for the local Soviet power. Same applies to [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgia]], although in this case I advise you to be even more careful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leninism.su/works/tom-51/pisma-mart-1920.html Ленин В. И.
