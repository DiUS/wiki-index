'''Marcus Antonius''' (in [[Latin]]: &lt;small&gt;M&#xB7;ANTONIVS&#xB7;M&#xB7;F&#xB7;M&#xB7;N&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Marcus Antonius Marci Filius Marci Nepos''; in [[English language|English]], "Marcus Antonius, son of Marcus, grandson of Marcus".&lt;/ref&gt;) (January 14, 83 BC &amp;ndash; August 1, 30 BC), known in [[English language|English]] as '''Mark Antony''', was a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] [[politician]] and [[general]]. As a military commander and administrator, he was an important supporter and loyal friend of his mother's cousin [[Julius Caesar]]. After [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar's assassination]], Antony formed an official political alliance with Octavian (the future [[Augustus]]) and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], known to historians today as the [[Second Triumvirate]].

The [[triumvirate]] broke up in 33&amp;nbsp;BC. Disagreement between Octavian and Antony erupted into civil war, the [[final war of the Roman Republic]], in 31&amp;nbsp;BC. Antony was defeated by Octavian at the naval [[Battle of Actium]], and in a brief land battle at [[Alexandria]]. He and his lover [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]] committed suicide shortly thereafter. His career and defeat are significant in Rome's transformation from [[Roman Republic|Republic]] to [[Roman Empire|Empire]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
A member of the [[Antonius|Antonia]] clan (''[[gens]]''), Antony was born in  the winter of 87-6 BC, or as late as 83, based on Plutarch's record of two traditions of his age at the time of his death in 30 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Antony'' 86.8&lt;/ref&gt; The day and month of his birth are securely attested as 14 January.&lt;ref&gt;W. Suerbaum, ''Chiron'' 10 (1980), 327-334&lt;/ref&gt; He was the homonymous and thus presumably the eldest son of [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]] (praetor 74 BC), grandson of the great [[Marcus Antonius (orator)|Marcus Antonius]] (consul 99 BC, censor 97-6 BC) who had been murdered and decapitated in the [[Gaius Marius#Seventh consulship and death|Marian Terror]] of winter 87-6 BC.

His mother [[Julia Antonia|Julia]] was a daughter of [[Lucius Julius Caesar III|Lucius Caesar]] (consul 90 BC, censor 89 BC), another Marian victim murdered with Antonius Orator. His father died in 71 BC during his command against Mediterranean piracy, and Julia remarried to [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus (Sura)]] (consul 71 BC), an eminent patrician politician and co-leader of the infamous Conspiracy of [[Catiline]] named after the latter. He had two younger brothers, [[Gaius Antonius|Gaius]] (praetor 44 BC, born c.84 BC) and [[Lucius Antonius (brother of Mark Antony)|Lucius]] (quaestor 50 BC, consul 41 BC, born 81 BC or earlier). The incompatibility of their birth dates with an eldest brother born in 83 BC indicates that the tradition making Antony 53 years of age at his death was the false one.

According to authorities like [[Plutarch]], he spent his youth wandering the streets of Rome with his brothers and friends, most notably [[Gaius Scribonius Curio]] (the later tribune 50 BC), with whom he is rumoured to have had a homosexual liaison, and whose wife [[Fulvia]] he took as his own a year or so after Curio's death in 49 BC. Plutarch writes that before Antony reached 20 years of age, he was already indebted to the sum of 250 [[Attic talent|talents]].&lt;ref name="Plutarch"&gt;Plutarch, "[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/antony.html Anthony]"&lt;/ref&gt; (About $5 million in today's money.)&lt;ref&gt;One talent had a purchasing power of about $20,000.[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html]. A talent represented nine years of wages for a craftsman.[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/engen.greece]&lt;/ref&gt;

After this period of recklessness, Antony fled to Greece to escape his creditors and to study [[rhetoric]]. After a short time spent in attendance on the philosophers at [[Athens]], he was summoned by [[Aulus Gabinius]], [[proconsul]] of [[Syria]], to take part in the campaigns against [[Aristobulus II]] in [[Judea]], and in support of King [[Ptolemy XII Auletes]] in Egypt. In the ensuing campaign, he demonstrated his talents as a cavalry commander and distinguished himself for his vigour and bravery.
Antony's life was a mixture of astounding military valour along with equally astounding debauchery.  In a similar vein, Plutarch noted that while his generosity helped raise him to the heights of power, he was equally hindered by his countless faults.&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Antony*.html Chapter 4, Verse 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporter of Caesar===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
In 54 BC, Antony became a staff officer in Caesar's armies in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] and Germany. He again proved to be a competent military leader in the [[Gallic Wars]], but his personality quirks caused disruption. Antony and Caesar were the best of friends, as well as being fairly close relatives. Antony made himself ever available to assist Caesar in carrying out his military campaigns.

Raised by Caesar's influence to the offices of [[quaestor]], [[augur]], and [[Tribune|tribune of the plebeians]] (50&amp;nbsp;BC), he supported the cause of his patron with great energy. Caesar's two proconsular commands, during a period of ten years, were expiring in 50&amp;nbsp;BC, and he wanted to return to Rome for the consular elections. But resistance from the conservative faction of the [[Roman Senate]], led by [[Pompey]], demanded that Caesar resign his proconsulship and the command of his armies before being allowed to seek re-election to the consulship. 

This Caesar would not do, as such an act would at least temporarily render him a private citizen and thereby leave him open to prosecution for his acts while proconsul. It would also place him at the mercy of Pompey's armies. To prevent this occurrence Caesar bribed the plebeian tribune [[Gaius Scribonius Curio|Curio]] to use his veto to prevent a senatorial decree which would deprive Caesar of his armies and provincial command, and then made sure Antony was elected tribune for the next term of office. Antony exercised his tribunician veto, with the aim of preventing a senatorial decree declaring martial law against the veto, and was violently expelled from the senate with another Caesar adherent, Cassius, who was also a tribune of the plebs. Caesar crossed the river [[Rubicon]] upon hearing of these affairs which began the [[Roman Republican civil wars|Republican civil war]]. Antony left Rome and joined Caesar and his armies at [[Ariminium]], where he was presented to Caesar's soldiers still bloody and bruised as an example of the illegalities that his political opponents were perpetrating, and as a [[casus belli]]. Tribunes of the Plebs were meant to be untouchable and their veto inalienable according to the Roman [[mos maiorum]] (although there was a grey line as to what extent this existed in the declaration of and during martial law). Antony commanded Italy whilst Caesar destroyed Pompey's legions in Spain, and led the reinforcements to Greece, before commanding the right wing of Caesar's armies at [[Pharsalus]]. 

When Caesar became [[Roman dictator|dictator]] for a second time, Antony was made [[Master of the Horse]], and in this capacity he remained in Italy as the peninsula's administrator in 47&amp;nbsp;BC, while Caesar was fighting the last Pompeians, who had taken refuge in the [[Africa Province|province of Africa]]. But Antony's skills as an administrator were a poor match for his generalship, and he seized the opportunity of indulging in the most extravagant excesses, depicted by [[Cicero]] in the ''[[Philippicae|Philippics]]''. In 46&amp;nbsp;BC he seems to have taken offense because Caesar insisted on payment for the property of Pompey which Antony professedly had purchased, but had in fact simply appropriated. Conflict soon arose, and, as on other occasions, Antony resorted to violence. Hundreds of [[Roman citizen|citizen]]s were killed and Rome itself descended into a state of anarchy. Caesar was most displeased with the whole affair and removed Antony from all political responsibilities. The two men did not see each other for two years. The estrangement was not of long continuance, with Antony meeting the dictator at Narbo (45&amp;nbsp;BC) and rejecting the suggestion of [[Trebonius]] that he should join in the conspiracy that was already afoot. Reconciliation arrived in 44&amp;nbsp;BC, when Antony was chosen as partner for Caesar's fifth consulship. 

Whatever conflicts existed between the two men, Antony remained faithful to Caesar but it is worth mentioning that according to Plutarch (paragraph 13) Trebonius, one of the conspirators, had 'sounded him unobtrusively and cautiously...Antony had understood his drift...but had given him no encouragement: at the same time he had not reported the conversation to Caesar'. On February 15, 44&amp;nbsp;BC, during the [[Lupercalia]] festival, Antony publicly offered Caesar a [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadem]]. This was an event fraught with meaning: a diadem was a symbol of a king, and in refusing it, Caesar demonstrated that he did not intend to assume the throne.

On March 14, 44&amp;nbsp;BC, Antony was alarmed when [[Cicero]] told him the gods would strike Caesar.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} [[Servilius Casca|Casca]], [[Cicero]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]]  decided, in the night before the [[Assassination of Julius Caesar]], that Mark Antony should stay alive.&lt;ref&gt;Together with English Literature, p. 17, Rachna Sagar
ISBN 9788181370921&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the [[Roman calendar|Ides of March]], he went down to warn the dictator but the ''[[Liberatores]]'' reached Caesar first and he was assassinated on March 15, 44 BC. In the turmoil that surrounded the event, Antony escaped Rome dressed as a slave; fearing that the dictator's assassination would be the start of a bloodbath among his supporters. When this did not occur, he soon returned to Rome, discussing a truce with the assassins' faction. For a while, Antony, as consul, seemed to pursue peace and an end to the political tension. Following a speech by Cicero in the Senate, an amnesty was agreed for the assassins. 

Then came the day of Caesar's funeral. As Caesar's ever-present second in command, co-consul and cousin, Antony was the natural choice to give the [[eulogy]]. In his [[Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears|speech]], he made accusations of murder and ensured a permanent breach with the [[Conspiracy (Caesar)|conspirators]]. Showing a talent for [[rhetoric]] and dramatic interpretation, Antony snatched the [[toga]] from Caesar's body to show the crowd the stab wounds, pointing at each and naming the authors, publicly shaming them. During the eulogy he also read Caesar's will, which left most of his property to the people of Rome: whatever Caesar's real intentions had been, Antony presumably meant to demonstrate that contrary to the conspirators' assertions, Caesar had no intention of forming a royal dynasty.{{Citation needed|reason=Conflicts with Augustus entry (he received two-thirds of Ceasar's estate).|date=December 2011}} Public opinion turned, and that night, the Roman populace attacked the assassins' houses, forcing them to flee for their lives.

===Enemy of the state and triumvirate===
[[Image:Antony with Octavian aureus.jpg|thumb|left|Roman [[aureus]] bearing the portraits of Mark Antony (left) and [[Augustus|Octavian]] (right). Struck in 41 BC, this coin was issued to celebrate the establishment of the [[Second Triumvirate]] by Octavian, Antony and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Lepidus]] in 43 BC. Both sides bear the inscription "III VIR R P C", meaning "One of Three Men for the Regulation of the Republic".&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | last = Sear | first = David R | title = Common Legend Abbreviations On Roman Coins | url = http://www.davidrsear.com/academy/roman_legends.html | accessdate = 2007-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Antony, left as sole Consul, surrounded himself with a bodyguard of Caesar's veterans and forced the senate to transfer to him the province of [[Cisalpine Gaul]], which was then administered by [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus]], one of the conspirators. Brutus refused to surrender the province and Antony set out to attack him in the beginning of [[43 BC|43&amp;nbsp;BC]], besieging him at Mutina. Encouraged by [[Cicero]], the Senate denounced Antony and in January 43 they granted Octavian imperium (commanding power), which made his command of troops legal and sent him to relieve the siege, along with [[Aulus Hirtius]] and [[Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus]], the consuls for 43 BC. In April 43, Antony's forces were defeated at the [[Battle of Forum Gallorum|Battles of Forum Gallorum]] and [[Battle of Mutina|Mutina]], forcing Antony to retreat to Transalpine Gaul. However, both consuls were killed, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.

When they knew that Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius were assembling an army in order to march on Rome, Antony, Octavian and Lepidus allied in November 43 BC, forming the [[Second Triumvirate]] to stop Caesar's assassins. [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] were defeated by Antony and Octavian at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in October 42 BC. After the battle, a new arrangement was made between the members of the Second Triumvirate: while Octavian returned to Rome, Antony went on to govern the east. Lepidus went on to govern Hispania and the province of Africa. The triumvirate's enemies were subjected to [[proscription]] including Mark Antony's archenemy Cicero who was killed on December 7, 43 BC.

===Antony and Cleopatra===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
[[Image:Lawrence Alma-Tadema- Anthony and Cleopatra.JPG|thumb|''Antony and Cleopatra'', by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema|Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] (1883)]]

Antony summoned [[Cleopatra]] to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in October 41 BC. There they formed an alliance and became lovers. Antony returned to Alexandria with her, where he spent the winter of 41 BC - 40 BC. In spring 40 BC he was forced to return to Rome following news of his wife Fulvia's involvement in civil strife with Octavian on his behalf. [[Fulvia]] died while Antony was en-route to Sicyon (where Fulvia was exiled). Antony made peace with [[Octavian]] in September 40 BC and married Octavian's sister [[Octavia Minor]]. 

The [[Parthian Empire]] had supported Brutus and Cassius in the civil war, sending forces which fought with them at Philippi; following Antony and Octavian's victory, the Parthians invaded Roman territory, occupying [[Syria]], advancing into [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and installing [[Antigonus the Hasmonean|Antigonus]] as puppet king in [[Judea|Judaea]] to replace the pro-Roman [[Hyrcanus II|Hyrcanus]]. Antony sent his general [[Publius Ventidius Bassus|Ventidius]] to oppose this invasion. Ventidius won a series of victories against the Parthians, killing the crown prince [[Pacorus I of Parthia|Pacorus]] and expelling them from the Roman territories they had seized. Antony now planned to retaliate by invading Parthia, and secured an agreement from Octavian to supply him with extra troops for his campaign. With this military purpose on his mind, Antony sailed to Greece with Octavia, where he behaved in a most extravagant manner, assuming the attributes of the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[god (male deity)|god]] [[Dionysus]] in 39&amp;nbsp;BC. But the rebellion in [[Sicilian revolt|Sicily]] of [[Sextus Pompeius]], the last of the Pompeians, kept the army promised to Antony in Italy. With his plans again disrupted, Antony and Octavian quarreled once more. This time with the help of  [[Octavia Minor|Octavia]], a new treaty was signed in [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in 38&amp;nbsp;BC. The triumvirate was renewed for a period of another five years (ending in 33&amp;nbsp;BC) and Octavian promised again to send legions to the East.

But by now, Antony was skeptical of Octavian's true support of his Parthian cause. Leaving Octavia pregnant with her second child Antonia in Rome, he sailed to [[Alexandria]], where he expected funding from Cleopatra, the mother of his twins. The queen of Egypt lent him the money he needed for the army, and after capturing [[Jerusalem]] and surrounding areas in 37 BC, he installed [[Herod the Great|Herod]] as puppet king of Judaea, replacing the Parthian appointee Antigonus. Antony then invaded Parthian territory with an army of about 100,000 Roman and allied troops but the campaign proved a disaster. After defeats in battle, the desertion of his Armenian allies and his failure to capture Parthian strongholds convinced Antony to retreat, his army was further depleted by the hardships of its retreat through [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]] in the depths of winter, losing more than a quarter of its strength in the course of the campaign.

Meanwhile, in Rome, the triumvirate was no more. Octavian forced Lepidus to resign after the older triumvir attempted an ill-judged political move. Now in sole power, Octavian was occupied in wooing the traditional Republican aristocracy to his side. He married [[Livia]] and started to attack Antony in order to raise himself to power. He argued that Antony was a man of low [[morals]] to have left his faithful wife abandoned in Rome with the children to be with the promiscuous queen of Egypt. Antony was accused of everything, but most of all, of "going native", an unforgivable crime to the proud Romans. Several times Antony was summoned to Rome, but remained in Alexandria with Cleopatra.

[[Image:Donations of Alexandria 34BC.gif&#x200E;|thumb|left|300px|A [[map]] of the ''[[Donations of Alexandria]]'' (by Mark Antony to Cleopatra and her children) in 34 BC]]

Again with Egyptian money, Antony invaded Armenia, this time successfully. In the return, a mock [[Roman Triumph]] was celebrated in the streets of Alexandria. The parade through the city was a [[pastiche]] of Rome's most important military celebration. For the finale, the whole city was summoned to hear a very important political statement. Surrounded by Cleopatra and her children, Antony ended his alliance with Octavian. He distributed kingdoms between his children: [[Alexander Helios]] was named king of [[Armenia]], [[Medes|Media]] and [[Parthia]] (which were never conquered by Rome), his twin [[Cleopatra Selene II|Selene]] got [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Libya]], and the young [[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]] was awarded Syria and [[Cilicia]]. As for Cleopatra, she was proclaimed Queen of Kings and Queen of Egypt, to rule with [[Caesarion]] (Ptolemy XV Caesar, son of Julius Caesar), King of Kings and King of Egypt. Most important of all, Caesarion was declared legitimate son and heir of Caesar. These proclamations were known as the ''[[Donations of Alexandria]]'' and caused a fatal breach in Antony's relations with Rome. 

While the distribution of nations among Cleopatra's children was hardly a conciliatory gesture, it did not pose an immediate threat to Octavian's political position. Far more dangerous was the acknowledgment of Caesarion as legitimate and heir to Caesar's name. Octavian's base of power was his link with Caesar through [[Adoption in Rome|adoption]], which granted him much-needed popularity and loyalty of the legions. To see this convenient situation attacked by a child borne by the richest woman in the world was something Octavian could not accept. The triumvirate expired on the last day of 33&amp;nbsp;BC and was not renewed. Another civil war was beginning.

[[Image:Castro Battle of Actium.jpg|thumb|''The Battle of Actium'', by Lorenzo Castro, 1672, [[National Maritime Museum]], London]]

During 33 and 32&amp;nbsp;BC, a propaganda war was fought in the political arena of Rome, with accusations flying between sides. Antony (in Egypt) divorced Octavia and accused Octavian of being a social upstart, of usurping power, and of forging the adoption papers by Caesar. Octavian responded with treason charges: of illegally keeping provinces that should be given to other men by [[Cleromancy|lots]], as was Rome's tradition, and of starting wars against foreign nations (Armenia and Parthia) without the consent of the Senate. Antony was also held responsible for [[Sextus Pompeius]]' execution with no trial. In 32&amp;nbsp;BC, the Senate deprived him of his powers and declared war against Cleopatra - not Antony, because Octavian had no wish to advertise his role in perpetuating Rome's internecine bloodshed. Both consuls, [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32 BC)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]] and [[Gaius Sosius]], and a third of the Senate abandoned Rome to meet Antony and Cleopatra in Greece.

In 31&amp;nbsp;BC, the war started. Octavian's loyal and talented general [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] captured the Greek city and naval port of [[Methoni, Messenia|Methone]], loyal to Antony. The enormous popularity of Octavian with the legions secured the defection of the provinces of Cyrenaica and Greece to his side. On September 2, the naval [[battle of Actium]] took place. Antony and Cleopatra's navy was destroyed, and they were forced to escape to Egypt with 60 ships.

Octavian, now close to absolute power, did not intend to give them rest. In August 30&amp;nbsp;BC, assisted by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]], he invaded Egypt. With no other refuge to escape to, Antony committed suicide by stabbing himself with his sword in the mistaken belief that Cleopatra had already done so. When he found out that Cleopatra was still alive, his friends brought him to Cleopatra's monument in which she was hiding, and he died in her arms. (However, some sources claim that he did not commit suicide but was killed by an Egyptian priest who was in favour of Octavian.) Cleopatra was allowed to conduct Antony's burial rites after she had been captured by Octavian. Realising that she was destined for Octavian's triumph in Rome, she made several attempts to take her life and was finally successful in mid-August. Octavian had Caesarion murdered, but he spared Antony's children by Cleopatra, who were paraded through the streets of Rome. Antony's daughters by Octavia were spared, as was his son, [[Iullus Antonius]].  But his elder son, [[Marcus Antonius Antyllus]], was killed by Octavian's men while pleading for his life in the Caesarium.

==Aftermath and legacy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
[[Cicero]]'s son, [[Cicero Minor]], announced Antony's death to the senate. Antony's honours were revoked and his statues removed (''[[damnatio memoriae]]''). Cicero also made a decree that no member of the [[Antonia (gens)|Antonii]] would ever bear the name [[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]] again. &#x201C;In this way Heaven entrusted the family of Cicero the final acts in the punishment of Antony.&#x201D;&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch. Fall of the Roman Republic. London: Penguin Classics, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Antony died, Octavian became uncontested ruler of Rome. In the following years, Octavian, who was known as [[Caesar Augustus|Augustus]] after 27&amp;nbsp;BC, managed to accumulate in his person all administrative, political, and military offices. When Augustus died in 14 AD, his political powers passed to his adopted son [[Tiberius]]; the Roman [[Principate]] had begun.

The rise of Caesar and the subsequent civil war between his two most powerful adherents effectively ended the credibility of the Roman [[oligarchy]] as a governing power and ensured that all future power struggles would centre upon which of two (or more) individuals would achieve supreme control of the government, rather than upon an individual in conflict with the Senate. Thus Antony, as Caesar's key adherent and one of the two men around whom power coalesced following his assassination, was one of the three men chiefly responsible for the fall of the [[Roman Republic]].

==Marriages and issue==
Antony had been married in succession to Fadia, Antonia, Fulvia, Octavia and Cleopatra, and left behind him a number of children. Through his daughters by Octavia, he would be ancestor to the [[Roman Emperor]]s [[Caligula]], [[Claudius]] and [[Nero]].
#Marriage to Fadia, a daughter of a [[freedman]]. According to [[Cicero]], Fadia bore Antony several children. Nothing is known about Fadia or their children. Cicero is the only Roman source that mentions Antony&#x2019;s first wife.
#Marriage to first paternal cousin Antonia Hybrida Minor. According to [[Plutarch]], Antony threw her out of his house in Rome, because she slept with his friend, the tribune [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella]]. This occurred by 47&amp;nbsp;BC and Antony divorced her. By Antonia, he had a daughter:
#*[[Antonia (daughter of Mark Antony)|Antonia, granddaughter of Gaius Antonius Hybrida]], married the wealthy Greek [[Pythodoros of Tralles|Pythodoros]] [[Tralles|of Tralles]].
#Marriage to [[Fulvia]], by whom he had two sons:
#*[[Marcus Antonius Antyllus]], murdered by Octavian in 30&amp;nbsp;BC.
#*[[Iullus Antonius]], married [[Claudia Marcella]] Major, daughter of Octavia.
#Marriage to [[Octavia the Younger]], sister of Octavian, later [[Augustus]]; they had two daughters:
#*[[Antonia Major]], married [[Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 16&amp;nbsp;BC)]]; maternal grandmother of the Empress [[Valeria Messalina]] and paternal grandmother of the [[Nero|Emperor Nero]].
#*[[Antonia Minor]], married [[Nero Claudius Drusus]], the younger son of the Empress [[Livia Drusilla]] and brother of the Emperor [[Tiberius]]; mother of the Emperor [[Claudius]], grandmother of the Emperor [[Caligula]] and Empress [[Agrippina the Younger]], and maternal great-grandmother of the emperor Nero.
#Children with the Queen [[Cleopatra&amp;nbsp;VII]] of [[Egypt]], the former lover of Julius Caesar:
#*The twins [[Alexander Helios]] &amp; [[Cleopatra Selene&amp;nbsp;II]]. Selene married King [[Juba&amp;nbsp;II]] [[Numidia|of Numidia]] and later [[Mauretania]]; the queen of [[Syria]], [[Zenobia]] [[Palmyra|of Palmyra]], is reportedly descended from Selene and Juba&amp;nbsp;II.
#*[[Ptolemy Philadelphus (Cleopatra)|Ptolemy Philadelphus]].

==Descendants==
Through his youngest daughters, Antony would become ancestor to most of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], the very family he had fought unsuccessfully to defeat.  Through his eldest daughter, he would become ancestor to the long line of kings and co-rulers of the [[Bosporan Kingdom]], the longest-living Roman [[client state|client kingdom]], as well as the rulers and royalty of several other Roman client states.  Through his daughter by Cleopatra, Antony would become ancestor to the royal family of [[Mauretania]], another Roman client kingdom, while through his sole surviving son [[Iullus Antonius|Iullus]], he would be ancestor to several famous Roman statesmen.
